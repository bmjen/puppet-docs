Download and install the Puppet Development Kit to get started developing and testing Puppet modules.

## Installing PDK

The PDK package includes testing tools, a complete module skeleton, and command line tools that help get you started creating and testing Puppet modules.

Specifically, the package includes:
[TODO: what exactly gets installed when you install the PDK package?]
[TODO: are we versioning this? what versions of things are included in this version?] [TODO: When do we update the PDK package and how do users get updates?]

Tool   | Description
----------------|-------------------------
pdk | Command line tool for generating and testing modules
rspec-puppet | Tests the behavior of Puppet when it compiles your manifests into a catalog of Puppet resources.
puppet-lint | Checks your Puppet code against the recommendations in the Puppet Language style guide.
puppet-syntax | Checks for correct syntax in Puppet manifests, templates, and Hiera YAML.
metadata-json-lint | Validates and lints `metadata.json` files in modules against  Puppet's module metadatastyle guidelines.
rspec-puppet-facts | Adds support for running rspec-puppet tests against the facts for your supported operating systems.
puppetlabs_spec_helper | Provides classes, methods, and Rake tasks to help with spec testing Puppet code.


PDK 1.0 is supported on: [TODO: update this table when support is finalized. These platforms are taken from [SDK-28](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SDK-28) and describe the preliminary platform support goals. Due to the scoping constraints, the platforms may include as little as Red Hat, Ubuntu, OS X, and Windows only.]

{:.section}
### Before you begin

PDK is a standalone development kit and does not require a pre-existing installation of Puppet. On Linux-based systems, you must enable the repository before you can download and install the package.

If you used an early release version of PDK, we recommend you uninstall it before installing PDK 1.0. Use your platform's package manager to uninstall any PDK versions earlier than 1.0, and then install the updated 1.0 package.

{:.task}
## Enable the PDK repository on Linux

Before you can download and install the PDK, enable the package repository to your respective Linux platform. 

```
[TODO] So this section is going to be confusing. What you have described is more like simply downloading/installing the package directly. Whereas enabling the package repo is different. The way it is described here is probably more accurate:
https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/3.8/install_el.html
https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/3.8/install_debian_ubuntu.html

Where the details of the repo are what's being downloaded and installed, as opposed to the package itself.
We will need to get the exact info from RE regarding this url and package repo name, but I imagine it will be something like:
- pdk-release-el7.rpm
- pdk-release-xenial.deb
```

{:.task}
### Enable PDK repo on Yum-based systems

Before you can install the PDK package, enable the repository on your Yum-based system.

1. Choose the package based on your operating system and version.

   Packages are located in the [`yum.puppet.com/pdk`](https://yum.puppet.com/pdk) repository and are named using the PDK package name and version, followed by the OS abbreviation and version.

   For instance, the PDK package for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7) is `pdk-1.0.0.-1.el7.x86_64.rpm`.

2. Install with `rpm` as root with the `upgrade` (`-U`) flag, and optionally the `verbose` (`-v`), and `hash` (`-h`) flags.

   For example:

   `sudo rpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/pdk/pdk-1.0.0.-1.el7.x86_64.rpm`

{:.task}
### Enable PDK repo on Apt-based systems

Before you can install the PDK package, enable the repository on your Apt-based system.

1. Choose the package based on your operating system and version.

   The packages are located in the [`apt.puppet.com/pdk`](https://apt.puppet.com/pdk) and are named using the PDK package name and version, followed by the OS abbreviation and version.

   For instance, the release package for Puppet Platform on Debian 7 "Wheezy" is `pdk-1.0.0-wheezy.deb`. For Ubuntu releases, the code name is the adjective, not the animal.

2. Download the PDK package and install it as root using `dpkg` and the `install` flag (`-i`):

```
wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/pdk-1.0.0-wheezy.deb < repo_package name TBD
sudo dpkg -i pdk-1.0.0-wheezy.deb
sudo apt-get update
```

3. Run `apt-get update` after installing the release package to update the `apt` package lists.

{:.task}
## Install PDK

Download the appropriate Puppet Development Kit package for your platform and install it.

### On Linux-based systems 

1. Confirm that you can run Puppet executables. [TODO: do users need to do this? Do we assume they have already done it, because they installed Puppet already or anything? Or is this step irrelevant to PDK?]

   The location for Puppet’s executables is /opt/puppetlabs/bin/, which is not in your PATH environment variable by default.

   The executable path doesn’t matter for Puppet services — for instance, service puppet start works regardless of the PATH — but if you’re running interactive puppet commands, you must either add their location to your PATH or execute them using their full path.

   To quickly add the executable location to your PATH for your current terminal session, use the command export PATH=/opt/puppetlabs/bin:$PATH. You can also add this location wherever you configure your PATH, such as your .profile or .bashrc configuration files.

1. Install the `puppet-pdk` package [TODO: where do they need to install pdk? the machine they are working on only? other machines?] using the command appropriate to your system:

   * Apt: `sudo apt-get install pdk`
   * Yum: `sudo yum install pdk`

### On OS X

1. Download the PDK package from [TODO link to the puppet-pdk package for OS X on the Puppet downloads site](downloads.puppetlabs.com).
2. Double click on the downloaded package to install.

### On Windows

1. Download the PDK package from [TODO link to the puppet-pdk MSI on the Puppet downloads site](downloads.puppetlabs.com).
2. Double click on the downloaded package to install.
