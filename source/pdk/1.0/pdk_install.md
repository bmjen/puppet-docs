Install the Puppet Development Kit (PDK) as your first step in creating and testing Puppet modules.

{:.section}
### Before you begin

PDK is a stand-alone development kit and does not require a pre-existing installation of Puppet.

If you used an early release version of PDK, we recommend you uninstall it before installing PDK 1.0. Use your platform's package manager to uninstall any PDK versions earlier than 1.0, and then install the updated 1.0 package.

By default, PDK installs to:

* Linux and OS X systems: `/opt/puppetlabs/pdk/`
* Windows systems: `C:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\DevelopmentKit`
